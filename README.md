# PRO-C98

. . . . 

## project class C-98 w/ whjr.
- this class focused on two main datatypes in python : LIST and TUPLE
- for loop was introdused
- `len()` , `slice()` and `range()` functions were introduced
- importance for indentation : segregation of data and statements to make code more readable and easily interpretable

#### In this class I learnt : 
- how to create and print LIST
- how to create and print TUPLE
- how to access and elemnt of a LIST and TUPLE based on the index numbers
- positive and negative Index numbers
- slicing of LIST and TUPLE
- LIST is mutable [ value of the elements of the list can be changed ] 
- TUPLE is immuatble [ value of elements of the tuple cannot be changed ] *(proof in cell4)*
- both are comma separated sequencial datatypes
- syntax for list `list1=[1, 2.5, 'dhriti', [1,8,'DDH']]`
- syntax for tuple `tuple1=(1, 2.5, 'dhriti', ['hello', 882]`
- the limitations of range function were experimented in cell 3 [code]

#### This project focuses on:
- **Q** -> create a python program in which the user enters a number along with the lower and upper range limit to find all numbers divisible by an entered number.
